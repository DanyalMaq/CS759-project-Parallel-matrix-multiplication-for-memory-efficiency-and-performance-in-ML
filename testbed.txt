1. Square matrices (nxn)
2^5 ... 2^20 (or up to whatever is feasible)


2. Increasing number of GPUs
Fixed matrix size (wherever the square matrix plot time spikes up)
numGPUs = 1...upto whatever is regularly available on Olvi

3. Rectangular matrices [(n x m) multiplied with (m x n)] 
n = 2^5 .. 2^20
m = 3^5 ... 3^20 
Feel free to change based on feasability

All of the above run for:
Managed kernel
Manual Allocation kernel
Async allocation kernel

4. MLP tests
First Layer 784 x 150
Second Layer 150 x 200
Third Layer 200 x 10
